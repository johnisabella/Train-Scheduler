README
This train scheduler allows users to enter four fields for known Hyperloop trains, including:
1) Train name
2) Train destination
3) Train start time (i.e. when does that train service begin)
4) Train frequency (how often does that train service run)

Once the user submits information for a specific hyperloop train, that information will be sent to a Firebase database for global storage. That train information will then be displayed in the black table for global viewing.

This project is a useful tool to share train information with a larger group.
